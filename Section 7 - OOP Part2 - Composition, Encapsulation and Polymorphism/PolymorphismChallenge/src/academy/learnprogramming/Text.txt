We are going to go back to the car analogy.

Create a base class called Car
It should have a few fields that would be appropriate for a generic car class.
engine, cylinders, wheels, etc.
Constructor should initialize cylinders (number of) and name, and set wheels to
4 and engine to true. Cylinders and names would be passed parameters.

Create appropriate getters.

Create some methods like startEngine, accelerate and brake.

show a message for each in the base class
Now create 3 sub classes for your favorite vehicles,
Override the appropriate methods to demonstrate polymorhism in use
put all classes in the one java file (Main.java)
