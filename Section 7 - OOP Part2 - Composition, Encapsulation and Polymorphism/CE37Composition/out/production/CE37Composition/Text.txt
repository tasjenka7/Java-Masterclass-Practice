This is an exercise in Class Composition. To complete the exercise, you must create five
classes with associated memeber variables and methods.
The five classes should be created as follows:

1) Create a class and name it Lamp. Inside the class should be declared three memeber variables:
style of type String, battery of type boolean, and globRating of type int. All variables
should be marked private. A constructor needs to be created which accepts the three member variables
as parameters. In addition four methods should be created:
    turnOn() has no return type and should print a message that the lamp is being turned on;
    getStyle() returns the lamp style;
    isBattery() returns the value of battery;
    getGlobRating() returns the globRating of the lamp

2)Create a class and name it Bed. Five private member variables should be declared:
    style of type String
    pillows, height, sheets, quilt of type int
  Constructor should be coded which accepts these five member variables as parameters.
  Also six methods should be defined:
    make() has no return type and prints a message to the effect that the bed is being made
    getStyle() which returns the value of style
    getPillows() returns the number of pillows on the bed
    getHeight() returns height
    getSheets() returns the number of sheets on the bed
    getQuilt() returns the value of quilt

3) Ceiling class:
    height and paintedColor of type int
    constructor with both member variables
    getHeight()
    getPaintedColor()

4) Wall class:
    direction - String
    constructor
    getDirection()

5) Bedroom class
    8 member variables:
        name String
        wall1, wall2, wall3, wall4 Wall
        ceiling Ceiling
        bed Bed
        lamp Lamp
    constructor - all 8
    2 methods:
        getLamp() -> returns an object of type Lamp
        makeBed() -> prints a message that the bed is being made and also calls the
                     make() method in the Bed class

Input/Output:
    In main class test:

    Wall wall1 = new Wall("West");
    Wall wall2 = new Wall("East");
    Wall wall3 = new Wall("South");
    Wall wall4 = new Wall("North");

    Ceiling ceiling = new Ceiling(12,55);

    Bed bed = new Bed("Modern", 4, 3, 2, 1);

    Lamp lamp = new Lamp("Classic", false, 75);

    Bedroom bedRoom = new Bedroom("Tamara", wall1, wall2, wall3, wall4, ceiling, bed, lamp);
    bedRoom.makeBed();

    bedRoom.getLamp().turnOn();

System.out.print("Bedroom -> Making bed | "); in makeBed() in Bedroom
System.out.print("Bed -> Making | "); in make() in Bed class
System.out.print("Lamp -> Turning on"); in turnOn() in Lamp class
