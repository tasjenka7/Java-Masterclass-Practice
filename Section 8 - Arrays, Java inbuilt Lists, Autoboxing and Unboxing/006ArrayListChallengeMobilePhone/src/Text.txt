Create a program that implements a simple mobile phone with the following capabilities.
Able to store, modify, remove and query contact names.
You will want to create a seperate class for Contacts (name and phone number).
Create a master class (MobilePhone) that holds the ArrayList of Constacts.
The MobilePhone class has the functionality listed above.
Add a menu of options that are available.
Options: Quit, print list of contacts, add new constact, update existing contact, remove constact
and search/find contact.
When adding or updating be sure to chech if the contact already exists(use name) --> hint for when doing this we want to say if it exists or not
Be sure not to expose the inner working of the ArrayList to MobilePhone
e.g. no ints, no .get(i) etc
MobilePhone should do everythinh with Contact objects only.
