Write a method called readIntegers() with a parameter called count that represents
how many integers the user needs to enter

The method needs to read from the console until all the numbers are entered, and then
return an array containing the number entered

Write a method findMin() with the array as the parameter. The method needs to return
the minimum value in the array.

In the main() method read the count from the console and call the method readIntegers()
with the count parameter.

Then call the findMin() method passing the array returned from the call to the readIntegers()
method.

Finally, print the minimum element in the array.

Tips:
    - Assume that the user will only enter numbers, never leters
    - For simplicity, create a Scanner as a static field to help with data input
    - Create a new console project with the name MinElementChallenge
