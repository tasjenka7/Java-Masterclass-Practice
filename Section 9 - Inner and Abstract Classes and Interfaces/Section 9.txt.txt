	123, 124. Interfaces

		So an interface, in Java terms, specifies methods that a particular class that implements the interface must implement.
		Interface that we create is abstract, it holds commont behaviour that can be used by several classes by having them implement the same interface

		create new class -> choose interface down and naming convention is ITelephone (I and then name)
			we define just the methods we want the class that uses the interface to have
		We don't write code in the interface, we write that in the class

		public or private in interface if actually useless because we don't call it 

		Create a class -> implements I...  it is red and it as to be either abstract class or to implement methods
		
		All methods from interface MUST be overriden, if we don't need it in a class just put a simple message

		ITelephone name;
		name = new DeskPhone()...      But we can't say ITelephone name = new ITelephone -> it automatically gives us a class to create

		If we initialize as I.. then we can use that variable for any class that implements that interface
--------------
	LinkedList interfaces
		if we change LinkedList with List it still works

		Java libraries are created in that way so that we can have maximum usage
	
		Vector is one more type of List 

		It's good to use generic list as a type and afterwards to declare an actual type.

		To create a class and inherit it or to create an interface? 	
			Think of a connection. In telephone example - desk phone is a phone, but mobile phone is more of a computer with phone interface. Class can only inherit from one super class, but can implement from many interfaces

	125, 126. Interface challenge
		trick-> when adding to an ArrayList<String> something that is an int 
				myList.add(index, "" + this.intValue)

		When overriding toString method InteliJ gives multiple templates to choose

		ISaveable werewolf = new Monster(...)
		We can't do: werewolf.getStrength() even though we have a getter, because it's not in an interface so we have to cast
		We have to do: ((Monster)werewolf).getStrength()  because it's from an actual class. If we declaired it as a Monster then we could use the regular way

		Usually we want it to be an interface that way our code is more generic
